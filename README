PGUI - IMGUI Python library
===========================

PGUI is a project I originally wrote during christmas 2009 when visiting my parents. I forgot about the while project until I found it again a while ago.
It still has a lot of improvements but currently it has a theme support and most of the common widgets work.
PGUI requires pygame library.


Current widget list:  
 * Button
 * CheckedButton
 * ScrollBar
 * TextBox
 * Text
 * CheckBox
 * EditText
 
PGUI also has support for automatic layouts:  
 * HorizontalLayout
 * VerticalLayout
 * GridLayout
 * AlignLeft

Layouts work by using Python _with_ statement:

	with VerticalLayout((300,10),(300,300)):
		Button('1')
		Button('2')
	
		with HorizontalLayout():
			Button('3')
			Button('4')
		

Check out the test.py for example of how to use the library.
